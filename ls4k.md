# Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling - 2023-06-08 12:24:30.329425064 -0300 -03 m=+0.011525588

Vertical scaling means adding more resources to the same machine, like adding more RAM, CPU, or storage to your server. 

Horizontal scaling means adding more machines to handle your load, like adding a new server to your server cluster.
Having multiple nodes also helps with redundancy. If one node goes down, the other nodes can take over the load.
