## Good production code is well-factored; good test code is obvious

Adding a layer of abstration in your test code is a bad idea. It makes your tests harder to understand and maintain. Good test codes should produce clear results without forcing reader to jump through multiple levels of indirection

## The next developer should be able to understand your tests without reading the production code

When you write a test, the next developer should not read your entire test suite to understand what your test is doing. They should be able to diagnose the problem by reading the test function in a straight line from top to bottom

## Violate DRY in your tests

DRY is a good principle for production code, but it's a bad idea for test code. If you find yourself writing the same test code over and over again, it's a sign that you're not writing good tests. You should be able to write a test that's specific to the problem you're trying to solve. If you find yourself writing the same test over and over again, it's a sign that you're not writing good tests.

## Make helpers obvious

If you need to add a helper method, make sure that it's obvious for reading the test

**bad example:**

```ruby
let(:add_new_account) do
  account = FactoryBot.create(:account, user: user, score: 100) 
  AccountService.new(account).add_new_account
end

context 'when changing account score' do 
  it 'can increase account score' do
    add_new_account
    increase_account_score(100)
    expect(account.score).to eq(200) # have to read the helper method to understand what it does and initialize the score
  end
end
```

**good example:**

```ruby
let(:add_new_account) do
  account = FactoryBot.create(:account, user: user, score: initial_score)
  AccountService.new(account).add_new_account
end

context 'when changing account score' do 
  let(:initial_score) { 100 }
  it 'can increase account score' do
    add_new_account
    increase_account_score(100)
    expect(account.score).to eq(200)
  end
end
```

## Embrace magic numbers

Magic numbers make your tests easier to understand. Avoid giving names to numbers that are only used once.

**bad example:**

```ruby
it 'adds hours to the account' do
  TEST_HOURS_TO_INCREASE = 8
  TESTING_STARTING_HOURS = 100

  account = FactoryBot.create(:account, user: user, hours: TESTING_STARTING_HOURS)
  AccountService.new(account).add_hours(TEST_HOURS_TO_INCREASE)

  expect(account.hours).to eq(TESTING_STARTING_HOURS + TEST_HOURS_TO_INCREASE)
end
```

**good example:**

```ruby
it 'adds hours to the account' do
  account = FactoryBot.create(:account, user: user, hours: 100)
  AccountService.new(account).add_hours(8)

  expect(account.hours).to eq(108)
end
```
