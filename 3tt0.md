## Stubbing methods in the object under test

This test now depends on the implementation of the object under test,
instead of checking outcomes, it works based on the implementation.
If the method name changes or the implementation is refactored, the test fails

```ruby
RSpec.describe Task do 
  it 'can determine urgency' do 
    t = Task.new(priority: 1)

    allow(t).to receive(:urgency_threshold).and_return(0)
    expect(t).to be_urgent

    allow(t).to receive(:urgency_threshold).and_return(2)
    expect(t).not_to be_urgent
  end
end
```

The solution is decouple the test from the implementation of the object, to a double

```ruby

RSpec.describe Task do 
  it 'can determine urgency' do 
    settings = double('settings')
    t = Task.new(priority: 1, settings: settings)

    allow(settings).to receive(:urgency_threshold).and_return(0)
    expect(t).to be_urgent

    allow(settings).to receive(:urgency_threshold).and_return(2)
    expect(t).not_to be_urgent
  end
end

```

## Stubbing a message expectation on the object under test

The only reason to set a message expectation in a test
is to verify the object being tested interacts with ther world
around it in the way the designer intended. But does couple the object itself

```ruby

it 'notifies the user' do 
  t = Task.new(priority: 1)
  expect(t).to receive(:notify_user)
  t.complete!
end
```

The solution is set expectations not on the object being tested,
but on the object it interacts with

```ruby
it 'notifies its user' do 
  user = double('user')
  t = Task.new(priority: 1, user: user)

  expect(user).to receive(:notify).with(t)
  t.complete!
end
```

## Stubbing a message expectation on a collaborator

The key practice is to separate our business logic
from thin adapters and gateway objects which encapsulate third-party libraries.
This way the business logic is not coupled to adapter
