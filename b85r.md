## Docker hub

Docker hub is a registry of docker images. You can find images for many applications and
programming languages. You can also create your own images and publish them in the hub.

- [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## List images

```bash
docker images
```

## Downloading an image

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

## Removing an image

```bash
docker rmi nginx
```

## Running a different version of an image

You can run a different version of an image by specifying the version after the image name.

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx:1.19.3
```

## Creating images with Dockerfile

- [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
- [Dockerfile best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

## Building an image

```bash
docker build -t my-nginx .
```

This doesn't create a container, it just creates an image. To create a container from this image, run:

```bash
docker run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 my-nginx
```

## removing all images

```bash
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```
