# Better performance with thread logging - 2023-05-14 23:57:41.878620412 -0300 -03 m=+838.710392366

We can create a #log specificy Thread to reduce #performance decrease from #logging a message in a server. 
Using this server as an example

[[57az]]

Adding a error log we can see the decrease in performance

```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "logger"

ERRLOG = Logger.new("error.log")

get "/" do
  ERRLOG.error "That thing happened again"
  send_file "alice.html", disposition: "inline"
end
```

*Results:* `Requests per second:    690.39 [#/sec] (mean)`

But we can increase the performance again, by adding a sleeping thread. This tells the thread to sleep every tenth of a second, so is not going to wake every time there is a new message, only a 1/10 of a second

```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "logger"

ERRLOG = Logger.new("error.log")
ERRQ   = Queue.new

t = Thread.new do
  loop do
    message_count = ERRQ.size
    message_count.times do
      message = ERRQ.pop
      ERRLOG.error message
    end
    sleep 0.1
  end
end
t.priority = -1

get "/" do
  ERRQ.push "That thing happened again"
  send_file "alice.html", disposition: "inline"
end
```
