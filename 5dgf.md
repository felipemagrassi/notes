## Benefits of documentation:
- Onboarding new team members
- Eradicates guesswork and reinventing the wheel

## What does a documenting culture look like?
> Every single thing that is not written down equals wasted resources in the future
and a potential for headaches

## When is a problem worth documenting?

- When people hunt you down for the same information over and over again
- When only one person knows how to solve a problem
