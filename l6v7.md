The role of the application service is to provide all the necessary plumbing and infrastructure
to execute the code. Providing dependencies required by the domain model and orchestrate flow &
usage of aggregates and entities.

Similar to Command handler in CQRS, but not exactly the same. Because command handler is
more likely to handle a single command.

## Responsibilities

*   Provide dependencies to the domain model ( Repositories, Adapters, Message Bus, Event Stores, Domain Services)
*   Orchestrate the flow of the domain model
*   Handle errors and exceptions

Make the domain object only responsible for the business logic and altering the state of the
object.

```ruby

class OrdersAddProductService
  def call(
	  order_number,
	  product_id,
	  quantity,
      prices_adapter = ProductPricesApiAdapter.new
  )
    order_repository.transaction do
      order = order_repository.find(order_number, lock: true)
      order.add_product(
        prices_adapter,
        product_id,
        quantity
      )
      order_repository.save(order)
    end
  end
end

```

## Can the application service read more than one object?

Yes, it can. It can read as many objects as it needs to perform the operation. As long as
they are part of the same bounded context.

```ruby

class OrdersAddProductService
  def call(order_number, product_id, quantity)
    Order.transaction do
      order = Order.lock.find(order_number)
      product = Product.find(product_id)
      order.add_product(product, quantity)
      order.save!
    end
  end
end

```

## Can the application service update more than one object?

Probably, but it's not recommended, as it increases coupling between aggregates and
generates potential issues:

*   Longer operations
*   Different lifecycle of aggregates. One can have a high-throughput and
    generates deadlocks, preventing the operation from completing. Also
    decreases the throughput of the other aggregate.
*   Objects persisted in different DBs, making the change not transactional

## Service arguments

One of the options is to pass a command to the service. In Ruby, a dry-rb, virtus, active model.

```ruby

class AddProductToOrderCommand
  attr_accessor :order_number,
                :product_id,
                :quantity
end

class OrdersAddProductService
  def call(command)
    command.validate!
    Order.transaction do
      order = Order.lock.find(command.order_number)
      product = Product.find(command.product_id)
      order.add_product(product, command.quantity)
      order.save!
    end
  end
end

```

Having commands makes it obvious what the service needs to perform the operation. It also
makes it easier to test the service. Also, when multiple commands have the same arguments,
it's easier to extract a common base class.

## Where should the command be instantiated

The command should be instantiated in the controller. The controller is responsible for
parsing the request and instantiating the command. It's also responsible for validating
the request.

```ruby

class Controller < ApplicationController
  def create
    cmd = MyCommand.new
    cmd.user_id = session.fetch(:user_id)
    cmd.product_id = params.fetch(:product).fetch(:id)
    ApplicationService.new.call(cmd)
    head :ok
  end
end

class Controller < ApplicationController
  def create
    cmd = MyCommand.new(
      user_id: session.fetch(:user_id)
      product_id: params.fetch(:product).fetch(:id)
    )
    ApplicationService.new.call(cmd)
    head :ok
  end
end

```

## Can the application service handle more than 1 operation ?

Yes, it can. It can handle as many operations as it needs to perform the operation. As long as
they are part of the same bounded context.

```ruby

class OrdersService
  def expire(order_number)
    with_order(order_number) do |order|
      # ...
    end
  end

  def add_product(order_number, product_id, quantity)
    with_order(order_number) do |order|
      # ...
    end
  end

  private

  def with_order(number)
    order_repository.transaction do
      order = order_repository.find(number, lock: true)
      yield order
      order_repository.save(order)
    end
  end
end

```

or

```ruby

class OrdersService
  def call(command)
    case command
    when ExpireOrderCommand
      expire(command)
    when AddProductToOrderCommand
      add_product(command)
    else
      raise ArgumentError
    end
  end

  private

  def expire(command)
    with_order(command.order_number) do |order|
      # ...
    end
  end

  def add_product(command)
    with_order(command.order_number) do |order|
      # ...
    end
  end

  def with_order(number)
    order_repository.transaction do
      order = order_repository.find(number, lock: true)
      yield order
      order_repository.save(order)
    end
  end
end

```

## Can the application service handle more than 1 command at the same time?

```ruby

class SetDeliveryMethodAndConfirmCommand
  attr_accessor :order_number,
                :delivery_method
end

class OrdersService
  def call(command)
    case command
    when SetDeliveryMethodAndConfirmCommand
      delivery_and_confirm(command)
    when ConfirmCommand
      confirm(command)
    when SetDeliveryMethodCommand
      set_delivery(command)
    # ...
    else
      raise ArgumentError
    end
  end

  private

  def delivery_and_confirm(command)
    with_order(command.order_number) do |order|
      # 2 operations on the same object
      order.set_delivery_method(command.delivery_method)
      order.confirm
    end
  end

  def confirm(command)
    # ...
  end

  def set_delivery(command)
    # ...
  end

  def with_order(number)
    order_repository.transaction do
      order = order_repository.find(number, lock: true)
      yield order
      order_repository.save(order)
    end
  end
end

```

or

```ruby

class BatchOfCommands
  attr_reader :commands

  def initialize
    @commands = []
  end

  def add_command(cmd)
    commands << cmd
    self
  end
end


class OrdersService
  def call(command)
    case command
    when BatchOfCommands
      batch(command.commands)
    when ConfirmCommand
      confirm(command)
    when SetDeliveryMethodCommand
      set_delivery(command)
    # ...
    else
      raise ArgumentError
    end
  end

  private

  def batch(commands)
    commands.each{|cmd| call(cmd) }
  end

  # ...
end

batch = BatchOfCommands.new
batch.
  add_command(SetDeliveryMethodCommand.new(...)).
  add_command(ConfirmCommand.new(...))

OrdersService.new.call(batch)

```

Processing multiple commands can lead to poor performance and it does not guarantee
that the commands will be processed in the same transaction.

Generally you want

*   One transaction per one operation
    *   simplest to implement
    *   worst performance
    *   short locks on the database
*   one transaction per one object
    *   balanced performance and lock time
    *   guaranteed a whole record processed or skipped
*   one transaction per the whole batch
    *   very long lock on many objects which might affect many other operations occurring at the same time
    *   guaranteed all or none records processed

## One transaction per one object approach

```ruby

class OrdersService
  def call(command)
    case command
    when BatchOfCommands
      batch(command.commands)
    when ConfirmCommand
      confirm(command)
    when SetDeliveryMethodCommand
      set_delivery(command)
    # ...
    else
      raise ArgumentError
    end
  end

  private

  def batch(commands)
    groupped_commands = commands.group_by(&:order_number)
    groupped_commands.each do |order_number, order_commands|
      with_order(number) do
        order_commands.each{|cmd| call(cmd) }
      end
    end
  end

  def confirm(command)
    with_order(command.order_number) do |order|
      order.confirm
    end
  end

  def with_order(number)
    if @order && @order.number == number
      yield @order
    elsif @order && @order.number != number
      raise "not supported"
    else
      begin
        order_repository.transaction do
          @order = order_repository.find(number, lock: true)
          yield @order
          order_repository.save(@order)
        end
      ensure
        @order = nil
      end
    end
  end

end

batch = BatchOfCommands.new
batch.
  add_command(SetDeliveryMethodCommand.new(...)).
  add_command(ConfirmCommand.new(...))

OrdersService.new.call(batch)

```

## What should the command contain?

*   id/uuid of related entities
*   data required to perform the operation
*   user performing the action
*   `user_id` action is performed on behalf of
