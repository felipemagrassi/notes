## Architecture Solution

### Software Enterprise

Ref: Fernando, Chanaka. Solution Architecture Patterns for Enterprise

- Software enterprise means software that runs on large Companies, either being a whole company
  or a BU (Business Unit) of the company.
- It can also be a government agency
- Companies that has multiple operations in different countries

### Enterprise Ecosystem

Enterprise Ecosystem is the set of people, processes, and technologies that interact with each other
and with the external world to deliver value to the enterprise.

People + Processes + Technologies = Governance (Enterprise management)

- How the technology is used to deliver value through the processes, so that the people can achieve
  the goals of the enterprise.

### Characteristics of Enterprise Ecosystem

- Scalable (Same throughput and performance even when demand increases)

- Availability (Availability in stressful situations, cost of downtime/availability)

  - Real time x Near real time x Batch

- Security

  - (What do you know, What do you own, Who is you) - Password, Certificate, Biometrics
  - LGPD
  - PCI
  - Own all data? (GDPR)
  - Security Layers

- Customizable and Modular

  - ERP and CRM are not customizable, lose competitive advantage and flexibility
  - Build your own software (Customizable and Modular)
  - Higher customization, higher maintenance cost

- Integration

  - Integration with other systems
  - Integration with other companies
  - Integration with other countries
  - Low Cost Integration

- Observability (Monitoring, Alerting, Logging, Tracing)
  - How to know if the system is working properly?
  - How to know if the system is not working properly?
  - Black box testing (Test the system without knowing the internals)

## Solutions Architecture

- Process to define structures, components, modules, interfaces of a
  software solution to satisfy specific functional and non-functional requirements,
  that correlates with the business goals and objectives.
- Defines the stack and technologies to be used
- Blueprints, guidelines, and best practices
- Enterprise software is complex, so the architecture is complex, simpler software
  does not require a solution architecture
